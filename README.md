This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning model capable of predicting the probability of customer default** at the time of a credit card application, even before any payment history is available.

Default prediction is critical to minimize financial losses, preserve institutional credibility, and provide fair and efficient access to credit. However, the task is challenging due to limited data at the application stage, potential classification errors (false positives/negatives), and the need for representative historical data.

The ultimate goal is to provide financial institutions with a **data-driven decision-support tool** that improves the accuracy and fairness of credit approval processes.
