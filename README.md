This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning model capable of predicting the customer default** at the time of a credit card application, even before any payment history is available.

Default prediction is critical to minimize financial losses, preserve institutional credibility, and provide fair and efficient access to credit. However, the task is challenging due to limited data at the application stage, potential classification errors (false positives/negatives), and the need for representative historical data.

The ultimate goal is to provide financial institutions with a **data-driven decision-support tool** that improves the accuracy and fairness of credit approval processes.

### Project Overview 

This project uses a dataset that contains customer application information and historical financial data. The objective is to predict whether a customer will default on a credit card based on their profile, such as age, income, previous credit history, and other factors. The model has been built using multiple machine learning techniques, including:

*   Gradient Boosting
*   Logistic Regression
*   Naive Bayes
*   SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) 


### Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
Imbalanced-learn (for handling imbalanced datasets with SMOTE)
Joblib (for saving and loading the model)
Pandas and Numpy (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebooks (for exploratory data analysis and prototyping)
